Using rem values
=================
When you look at the style.css file you will notice that a majority of the values use rem (not em). I used the following tool to help with determining what rem value I needed to add:

*When inputting a value for these divs, you can use px if that is what you are comfortable with. I do however recommend you using rem values.
